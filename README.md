# msr-policy-causal-llm

## Problem
This repository will host a small prototype for evaluating the **stability of policy conclusions** when an analysis pipeline includes:
1) privacy-preserving data substitutes (when microdata cannot be shared), and  
2) AI/LLM-assisted steps (e.g., summarization, coding, or evidence extraction).

## Artifacts
- `docs/WritingSample-Young.pdf`: A Privacy-Preserving Replication Pack for Environmental Health & Development Research
- `notebooks/demo.ipynb`: end-to-end demo producing one table/figure
- `results/`: example outputs (table/figure) with short interpretation notes

## Why this matters
Policy analysis increasingly uses LLM-assisted workflows and confidential data. This project focuses on auditability, reproducibility, and robustness diagnostics for decision-relevant conclusions.

## Status
Writing sample is available. Additional demo artifacts will be added by Feb 8, 2026.
